The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/\">3.4</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/\">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href=\"http://ios.wordpress.org/\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"http://android.wordpress.org/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"http://blackberry.wordpress.org/\">Blackberry</a>, <a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/\">Windows Phone</a>, <a href=\"http://nokia.wordpress.org/\">Nokia</a>, and <a href=\"http://webos.wordpress.org/\">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/\">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">core</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">theme review</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/support/\">forum support</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/docs/\">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/\">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit\">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href=\"http://sopastrike.com/numbers/\">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans. If you didn&#8217;t make it to a WordCamp this year, maybe it can be one of your new year resolutions: <a href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">check the schedule</a> to find one near you!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/2012-a-look-back/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"WordPress 3.5 “Elvin”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:54:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2517\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:363:\"It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year: a new WordPress release is available and chock-full of goodies to delight bloggers and developers alike.

Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id=\"v-jQDfEbzZ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><embed id=\"v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video\" src=\"http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"692\" height=\"388\" title=\"Introducing WordPress 3.5\" wmode=\"direct\" seamlesstabbing=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" overstretch=\"true\"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory. The <a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/\">Underscore</a> and <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone</a> JavaScript libraries are now available. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5\">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features above and beyond this</a>, and you can always <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5\">grab a warm beverage and explore Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Percussion Section</h3>\n<p>Behind every great release is great contributors. 3.5 had more people involved than any release before it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell\">Aaron D.

Today we&#8217;re happy to announce gallery support for WordPress.com blogs and direct access to your WordPress Dashboard and public website.</p>\n<p>Galleries are a great way to share pictures with your friends and followers. An image gallery will display thumbnails for all images attached to a particular post or page. Readers can tap or click any image to launch the gallery full-screen, displaying huge versions of your images.</p>\n<p>You can create a gallery straight from your device by attaching two or more pictures to a post or a page. You can even customize the appearance of a gallery by tapping the &#8220;gallery settings&#8221; button and choosing the best options for your site.</p>\n<h3>Gallery Styles</h3>\n<p>You have great control over how the gallery will be displayed: as a thumbnail grid, as a tiled mosaic-style grid, or as a slideshow. A tiled mosaic-style grid has Rectangular, Square, and Circular formatting options, for a total of 5 choices.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of an image gallery using the default thumbnail setting. If you click on any of the images you will be able to see what the carousel view looks like:<br />\n\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/01-dashboard/\" title=\"01-dashboard\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/02-write-screen/\" title=\"02 - write screen\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/03-gallery-settings/\" title=\"03- gallery settings\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/04-gellery-settings/\" title=\"04 - gellery-settings\"><img /></a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gallery with square tiles</strong><br />\n\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/02/\" title=\"Fire Hydrant\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/03/\" title=\"Pier\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/04/\" title=\"Rooftops\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/05/\" title=\"Balcony\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/06/\" title=\"Restaurant\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/07/\" title=\"Boardwalk\"><img /></a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gallery with circular tiles</strong><br />\n\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/02/\" title=\"Fire Hydrant\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/03/\" title=\"Pier\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/04/\" title=\"Rooftops\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/05/\" title=\"Balcony\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/06/\" title=\"Restaurant\"><img /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/attachment/07/\" title=\"Boardwalk\"><img /></a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gallery as a slideshow</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/#gallery-383-1-slideshow\">Click to view slideshow.</a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wpwindowsphone-2-0-dashboard-and-website-access.png\"><img src=\"http://wpwindowsphone.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wpwindowsphone-2-0-dashboard-and-website-access.png?w=300&h=560\" alt=\"Version 2.0 of WordPress for Windows Phone: Dashboard and Website Access\" width=\"300\" height=\"560\" class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-422\" /></a>Easy Site and Dashboard Access</h3>\n<p>A no brainer.

These moderators are WordPress enthusiasts &#8212; just like many of you out there &#8212; and we want to share their stories about how they got involved with WordPress.</p>\n<p>First up in our Q&amp;A series? Jerry Bates.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-220\"></span></p>\n<h3>Jerry Bates<br />\nSan Jose, CA</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_244\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://wptvblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jerry.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-244\" alt=\"Jerry Bates\" src=\"http://wptvblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jerry.jpeg?w=300&h=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jerry Bates</p></div>\n<h4>How did you get involved with WordPress?</h4>\n<p>I found WordPress sort of by accident &#8212; I was looking for a way, as a non-coder, to build a website for myself. I had no concept of “open source” or “community” at the time, but WordPress was the perfect solution for what I needed. Fast forward a few years, and I&#8217;ve built a business (and a lot of websites) based solely on WordPress, which I think is pretty amazing!</p>\n<p>I attended my first <a href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp</a> &#8212; WordCamp San Francisco 2011 &#8212; and it was an incredible experience. Not only did I come away a whole lot smarter, but I experienced a “community” spirit firsthand and was impressed by the accessibility of the core team, speakers, and even Matt himself. WordPress went from being a tool to build sites to something <em>I felt a part of</em>. I decided I wanted to find ways to make my own contributions.</p>\n<p>Since that first WordCamp experience, I&#8217;ve been active in the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org support forums</a>, participate on documentation and UI discussions for core, and now moderate videos. I was even able to help <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22610\" target=\"_blank\">contribute directly</a> to WordPress 3.5 as well. If I have learned anything since that first WordCamp, it&#8217;s that if you truly want to help make WordPress better, your contributions will be welcomed by the community. <b> </b>It is an incredibly rewarding thing in which to be involved.</p>\n<h4>What do you do when you&#8217;re not helping out with WordPress projects?</h4>\n<p>I run a little web design studio called <a href=\"http://www.fittingsites.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FittingSites</a>. I have been designing and building WordPress-powered sites for clients since 2010, though first started using WordPress myself in 2007. Before WordPress, I was a “traditional” graphic designer and commercial photographer, and because of this foundation, good design and a well-thought-out user experience are still important to me, even today.</p>\n<h4>Why do you want to be a WordPress.tv moderator?</h4>\n<p>I think video is a great way to learn, and something I&#8217;m attracted to because of my background in photography. I&#8217;ve always viewed WordPress.tv as a useful WordPress resource, but one that I feel could be improved. When I heard about the call for moderators, I jumped at the chance. I now get to be directly involved in two things I’m passionate about &#8212; video and WordPress &#8212; and use them to help make WordPress education more accessible to everyone. Plus, I learn so much “on the job” simply by watching all of these informative WordCamp presentations, which is an awesome fringe benefit.</p>\n<h4>What other things do you like to do?</h4>\n<p>When I&#8217;m not online, I enjoy collecting (and sometimes using) old-school cameras, cooking, and working on my classic car, which I&#8217;m slowly restoring.<b>  </b></p>\n<p><em>Stay tuned for the next Q&amp;A in this series!

This year&#8217;s default theme is overseen by <a href=\"http://ma.tt\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, and built by <a href=\"http://noscope.com\">Joen Asmussen</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wp.obenland.it\">Konstantin Obenland</a>, and <a href=\"http://simpledream.net\">Lance Willett</a>.</p>\n<p>The goal for Twenty Thirteen is to offer &#8220;a focus on blogging, and great support for post formats (which are getting <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/post-formats/\">attention</a> on the backend in 3.6 as well).&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to see the theme in action, <a href=\"http://twentythirteendemo.wordpress.com\">a demo site</a> is available. One thing you&#8217;ll notice immediately is that the strong emphasis on whitespace, which has become commonplace in the default themes, is long-gone. Twenty Thirteen is making very bold use of its colors, offering a different color for each post format. The theme also lacks a sidebar by default. It&#8217;s designed to focus on blogging after all, so the designers prefer that you leave your widgets to the footer area, but it still does support a sidebar widget area if you really want to put something there.</p>\n<p>This theme won&#8217;t be for everyone, and really no default theme should. Default themes should showcase the strength of each release&#8217;s new features and inspire customization. If you aren&#8217;t a fan of Twenty Thirteen, don&#8217;t worry, there are still <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/\">over 1,600 themes</a> to choose from, including <a

As Bill Slawski pointed out in the comments, Paul has written articles on SEO <a href=\"http://boagworld.com/marketing/i-dont-get-seo/\">before</a>. Paul, whom I respect tremendously for his web development work, obviously doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; SEO and has evidently had some bad experiences with the snake oil side of our trade over the years. Luckily he&#8217;s shown himself to be willing to learn and I hope to be part of that learning experience. But I also wanted to write about this as I think it&#8217;s important for our industry.</p>\n<p>His main argument, after you remove the link-bait title and the weird introduction, is that what <em>we</em> SEO&#8217;s call SEO these days, shouldn&#8217;t be called SEO as it should be called (decent) web development. I agree in large part with that statement. But here&#8217;s the kicker: if a web developer or web development agency fails (and they do, very often, very miserably), the client often doesn&#8217;t notice. The web developer often delivers a shiny new website with all the bells and whistles that the management asked about. The fact that technically, information structurally and architecturally, the entire site is a mess, will not be noticed by 99% of clients. At least&#8230;</p>\n<p>Not until they notice their analytics, or rather, the fact that their phone stops ringing. And they notice one specific thing: a big hole in their traffic, where organic traffic from search engines used to be. That&#8217;s when they call an SEO, because those are the people that know about search engines, right? That, Paul, is why we&#8217;re still called SEO&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a demand driven thing: the client wants more search traffic, so he / she searches for someone that delivers that to them. They don&#8217;t know that their web developer did a lousy job, it&#8217;s <em>our</em> job to tell that to them.</p>\n<p>In our <a href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/\">website reviews</a> we encounter, on a daily basis, websites that have been redesigned where the web developer / designer deemed it &#8220;not necessary&#8221; to do 301 redirects from the old URL structure to the new one. Where development environments are left open for Google to index and a few wrong links in the content mistakenly go <em>to</em> that development environment, causing havoc for the website in question. Websites where a fancy new faceted based search system causes 4.5 <em>billion</em> URLs (actual example), to be created and Google slowly indexes all of them, leaving the websites ranking in dust. I can go on for hours.</p>\n<p>My buddy <a href=\"http://theuws.com\">Richard</a> commented:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But what if they call it “inbound marketing”?</p></blockquote>\n<p>To which Paul said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I much prefer that. It does not apply that sites should be optimised for search engines over users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sigh. First of all, if SEO means anything, it&#8217;s that we optimize the search engine, not the site. The term is a weird acronym, but people know it now, so we stick with it. You see, even when BMW wants to sell &#8220;mobility&#8221;, in the end they sell cars. We all <em>want</em> to sell website optimization, but in the end, people come to us for SEO. That we&#8217;ll give them website optimization as a result doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>\n<p>Also in the comments, <a href=\"http://www.seobythesea.com/about-seo-by-the-sea/\">Bill Slawski</a> said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A person who uses things like keyword density and gateway pages is not an SEO, and never has been.</p>\n<p>But, if you need help with hreflang, canonical link elements, parameter handling, rel prev and next values for pagination, XML sitemaps for pages and images and videos and news, Google Plus authorship markup, Facebook’s Open Graph meta data, schema.org implementation, and many other issues that great content alone will not solve, an SEO can help you with those.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To his credit, Paul <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/11/seo-the-inconvenient-truth/#comment-985658\">responded</a> to that thanking Bill and stating that these:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; are not things I would expect any half decent web designers to do as part of their job.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well to be honest Paul, I do expect a decent web designer to know that stuff and if he doesn&#8217;t, I expect him, and thus you, to stop commenting about SEO until you <em>do</em> know about that stuff. You obviously don&#8217;t, because If I take your article from 2010, linked above, as an example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you haven&#8217;t implemented <a href=\"http://yoast.com/push-rel-author-head/\">rel=&#8221;author&#8221;</a>;</li>\n<li>I can&#8217;t find an XML sitemap;</li>\n<li>most of the pages on his site except for singular posts and pages lack a decent <a href=\"http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/\">rel=&#8221;canonical&#8221; link element</a>;</li>\n<li>there is no <a href=\"http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\">rel=&#8221;prev&#8221; / rel=&#8221;next&#8221;</a> implementation on his archives;</li>\n<li>in fact, there is no decent pagination on those archives at all, and lastly;</li>\n<li>there is no schema.org markup.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I could go on. So, Paul, you say in your article that SEO should be decent web development, but you obviously haven&#8217;t kept up to date with what decent web development is then. I have an easy fix for you though. If you install my (100% free as in beer) <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> and take 2 minutes to configure it, 1 through 4 will be taken care of for you by that plugin, automatically. But if you do that I will take that as an acceptance that there is a very <em>convenient</em> truth about SEO. I trust I&#8217;ll get to convince you that SEO is worth while, but I think the world deserves more than just a comment on your post as a counter argument to your headline, which I know you now regret.</p>\n<p>Let this be the first step in me, and others, convincing you of the value in SEO. I very much hope to see an article from your hand in 6 to 12 months time stating you were wrong.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yoast.com/seo-paul-boag/\">Want SEOs to lose their job?

As Bill Slawski pointed out in the comments, Paul has written articles on SEO <a href=\"http://boagworld.com/marketing/i-dont-get-seo/\">before</a>. Paul, whom I respect tremendously for his web development work, obviously doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; SEO and has evidently had some bad experiences with the snake oil side of our trade over the years. Luckily he&#8217;s shown himself to be willing to learn and I hope to be part of that learning experience. But I also wanted to write about this as I think it&#8217;s important for our industry.</p>\n<p>His main argument, after you remove the link-bait title and the weird introduction, is that what <em>we</em> SEO&#8217;s call SEO these days, shouldn&#8217;t be called SEO as it should be called (decent) web development. I agree in large part with that statement. But here&#8217;s the kicker: if a web developer or web development agency fails (and they do, very often, very miserably), the client often doesn&#8217;t notice. The web developer often delivers a shiny new website with all the bells and whistles that the management asked about. The fact that technically, information structurally and architecturally, the entire site is a mess, will not be noticed by 99% of clients. At least&#8230;</p>\n<p>Not until they notice their analytics, or rather, the fact that their phone stops ringing. And they notice one specific thing: a big hole in their traffic, where organic traffic from search engines used to be. That&#8217;s when they call an SEO, because those are the people that know about search engines, right? That, Paul, is why we&#8217;re still called SEO&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a demand driven thing: the client wants more search traffic, so he / she searches for someone that delivers that to them. They don&#8217;t know that their web developer did a lousy job, it&#8217;s <em>our</em> job to tell that to them.</p>\n<p>In our <a href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/\">website reviews</a> we encounter, on a daily basis, websites that have been redesigned where the web developer / designer deemed it &#8220;not necessary&#8221; to do 301 redirects from the old URL structure to the new one. Where development environments are left open for Google to index and a few wrong links in the content mistakenly go <em>to</em> that development environment, causing havoc for the website in question. Websites where a fancy new faceted based search system causes 4.5 <em>billion</em> URLs (actual example), to be created and Google slowly indexes all of them, leaving the websites ranking in dust. I can go on for hours.</p>\n<p>My buddy <a href=\"http://theuws.com\">Richard</a> commented:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But what if they call it “inbound marketing”?</p></blockquote>\n<p>To which Paul said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I much prefer that. It does not apply that sites should be optimised for search engines over users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sigh. First of all, if SEO means anything, it&#8217;s that we optimize the search engine, not the site. The term is a weird acronym, but people know it now, so we stick with it. You see, even when BMW wants to sell &#8220;mobility&#8221;, in the end they sell cars. We all <em>want</em> to sell website optimization, but in the end, people come to us for SEO. That we&#8217;ll give them website optimization as a result doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>\n<p>Also in the comments, <a href=\"http://www.seobythesea.com/about-seo-by-the-sea/\">Bill Slawski</a> said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A person who uses things like keyword density and gateway pages is not an SEO, and never has been.</p>\n<p>But, if you need help with hreflang, canonical link elements, parameter handling, rel prev and next values for pagination, XML sitemaps for pages and images and videos and news, Google Plus authorship markup, Facebook’s Open Graph meta data, schema.org implementation, and many other issues that great content alone will not solve, an SEO can help you with those.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To his credit, Paul <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/11/seo-the-inconvenient-truth/#comment-985658\">responded</a> to that thanking Bill and stating that these:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; are not things I would expect any half decent web designers to do as part of their job.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well to be honest Paul, I do expect a decent web designer to know that stuff and if he doesn&#8217;t, I expect him, and thus you, to stop commenting about SEO until you <em>do</em> know about that stuff. You obviously don&#8217;t, because If I take your article from 2010, linked above, as an example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you haven&#8217;t implemented <a href=\"http://yoast.com/push-rel-author-head/\">rel=&#8221;author&#8221;</a>;</li>\n<li>I can&#8217;t find an XML sitemap;</li>\n<li>most of the pages on his site except for singular posts and pages lack a decent <a href=\"http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/\">rel=&#8221;canonical&#8221; link element</a>;</li>\n<li>there is no <a href=\"http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\">rel=&#8221;prev&#8221; / rel=&#8221;next&#8221;</a> implementation on his archives;</li>\n<li>in fact, there is no decent pagination on those archives at all, and lastly;</li>\n<li>there is no schema.org markup.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I could go on. So, Paul, you say in your article that SEO should be decent web development, but you obviously haven&#8217;t kept up to date with what decent web development is then. I have an easy fix for you though. If you install my (100% free as in beer) <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> and take 2 minutes to configure it, 1 through 4 will be taken care of for you by that plugin, automatically. But if you do that I will take that as an acceptance that there is a very <em>convenient</em> truth about SEO. I trust I&#8217;ll get to convince you that SEO is worth while, but I think the world deserves more than just a comment on your post as a counter argument to your headline, which I know you now regret.</p>\n<p>Let this be the first step in me, and others, convincing you of the value in SEO. I very much hope to see an article from your hand in 6 to 12 months time stating you were wrong.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yoast.com/seo-paul-boag/\">Want SEOs to lose their job?

Which countries do people search for wheelchair transportation on the internet?\r\n\r\nAt least <a href=\"http://www.google.ca/trends/\">Google Trends</a> sheds some lights on trying to answer some of these questions. Google exposes where and when the search happened the most given the search keyword. I tried \'wheelchair\'.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/trend1.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" alt=\"search traffic for wheelchair\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/trend1.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"428\" /></a> search traffic for \'wheelchair\'[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe page shows \'wheelchair\' worldwide search traffic since 2004 to present. We can see that the traffic came mostly from United States, but a lot of traffic also came from Canada as well. I wanted to see which city people searched for \'wheelchair\', so I clicked \"City\" link to see the data.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"398\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/trend2.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" alt=\"the list of cities from where people searched for wheelchair\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/trend2.jpg\" width=\"398\" height=\"387\" /></a> The list of cities from where people searched for \'wheelchair\'[/caption]\r\n\r\nNote that the number besides the blue bar represent the search volume relative to the highest point on the chart, which is always 100. So in this case the search traffic for \'wheelchair\' from Toronto is about two third of the traffic coming from Dublin. And Toronto is the only city listed here.\r\n\r\nWe can see from the page that wheelchair search traffic is steady, and also a lot of people who searched for \'wheelchair\' usually also searched for keywords like \'wheelchair accessible\', \'wheelchair rental\', \'electric wheelchair\', etc. Since we are a wheelchair accessible transportation company, I typed \'wheelchair taxi\' to see what is the search trend for this keyword.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/trend3.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" alt=\"search trend for wheelchair taxi\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/trend3.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"377\" /></a> search trend for \'wheelchair taxi\'[/caption]\r\n\r\nSurprisingly there isn\'t much traffic for this throughout Canada, but the most of traffic comes from British Columbia and Ontario only. The city-level information is not available for this keyword. I think the reason is that the search volume for this keyword is substantially smaller than \'wheelchair\' or other popular keywords, so the information is too granular to expose to public.\r\n\r\nThe keyword for \'wheelchair transportation\' shows the similar graph.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/trend4.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" alt=\"wheelchair transportation\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/trend4.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"370\" /></a> keyword \'wheelchair transportation\'[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe pattern looks similar to \'wheelchair taxi\' except that the traffic is now highly concentrated on Ontario. Still overall the search volume is very small.\r\n\r\nI think there are not much data to draw any conclusion in this case because there aren\'t much traffic for wheelchair transportation in general. But I think Google Trends is a handy tool to help assess what people search for the most and quickly see where and when people look for stuff.','Wheelchair on Google Trends','','inherit','closed','open','','35-revision-10','','','2013-02-01 00:44:48','2013-02-01 05:44:48','',35,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/35-revision-10/',0,'revision','',0),(75,1,'2013-02-01 23:58:03','2013-02-02 04:58:03','Wheelchair-accessible ramps are essential for easier access to buildings and stores that have doorsteps and stairs to their entrances. Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) mandates that all the businesses regardless of their sizes ensure their services are accessible to people with disabilities. And having wheelchair-accessible ramps could remove physical barriers to enter their businesses, which is the first step to comply with AODA.\r\n\r\nAODA, however, does not regulate the wheelchair ramp designs, so we often see many poorly designed ramps that not only cause negative experiences but also pose a barrier that can be dangerous to people.\r\n\r\nSo, what can be a good wheelchair accessible ramp? How should we install the ramps so that they really benefit people in wheelchairs? There are few things to consider, which are 1) slope, 2) landing experiences, 3) visibility, and 4) maintenance.\r\n<h2>Slope</h2>\r\nThe ramp slope should be low enough to make the climb easier for wheelchair users. If the angle is too steep then it will make the ramp difficult to climb and also could be dangerous. There is currently no regulation regarding the wheelchair ramp slope in Canada, but other countries including United States and United Kingdom require a 1:12 slope for wheelchair ramps. This means 1\'\' of rise requires 12\'\' of ramp.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1TvlQzANhAw/UQyWYggQYmI/AAAAAAAAAMI/_5RHTBn2NwA/s569/dec8fa726cea11e2990322000a9f192c_7.jpg\"><img alt=\"wheelchair ramp with lower slope\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1TvlQzANhAw/UQyWYggQYmI/AAAAAAAAAMI/_5RHTBn2NwA/s569/dec8fa726cea11e2990322000a9f192c_7.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a> It is common that slopes \"go around\" the stairs to have a lower slope and longer length.[/caption]\r\n<h2>Landing Experience</h2>\r\nLanding experience is as much important as climb up the ramp. Usually the landing side of the ramp should have enough space to rest and proceed towards the building entrance. We often notice that many businesses do not provide good landing experiences even if they provide wheelchair ramps on their doorsteps.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-etTSTMsbFHg/UQyWX9-YdAI/AAAAAAAAAL4/clO_HlD0YPI/s569/521565_411351278952390_1771367635_n.jpg\"><img class=\" \" alt=\"wheelchair ramp with negative landing experience\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-etTSTMsbFHg/UQyWX9-YdAI/AAAAAAAAAL4/clO_HlD0YPI/s569/521565_411351278952390_1771367635_n.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a> Wheelchair users will have hard time pulling open these doors while on the ramp.[/caption]\r\n<h2>Visibility</h2>\r\nThe wheelchair ramps should be installed close to the stairs and must be visible and apparent to people who need them. Ideally the wheelchair users should be able to find the ramps without any sign, but if the ramps are somehow hard to find due to constructions or temporary disruptions, there must be a sign indicating an alternate route to wheelchair ramps.\r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\r\nWinter involves heavy snowfall in Greater Toronto Area and Ontario in general. Maintenance is necessary to ensure that there is no snow accumulation that could block both the approach and the landing of the ramp. This problem could be seen mostly in the sidewalk ramps, where snow is often plowed onto the sidewalk to build the banks and block the ramps.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ENvKGPAHpbU/UQyWYUNrfoI/AAAAAAAAAMA/iYKC7mWA4m4/s569/c0797b9a6cf011e2a94622000a1fbd9f_7.jpg\"><img class=\" \" alt=\"snow covering sidewalk ramps\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ENvKGPAHpbU/UQyWYUNrfoI/AAAAAAAAAMA/iYKC7mWA4m4/s569/c0797b9a6cf011e2a94622000a1fbd9f_7.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a> After heavy snowfall, the hard-packed snow could block the sidewalk ramps.[/caption]\r\n\r\nSlope, landing experience, visibility, and maintenance are some of the things to consider when installing the accessible ramps. It is a bit surprising that Ontario (or Canada) does not provide any regulation on how the ramps should be installed. Since no regulation is enforced there are many ramps out there that are just inadequate to use. The wheelchair ramps at least should meet the points mentioned above to provide better accessibility to wheelchair users.','What makes a good wheelchair ramp?','','inherit','closed','open','','56-revision-18','','','2013-02-01 23:58:03','2013-02-02 04:58:03','',56,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/56-revision-18/',0,'revision','',0),(16,1,'2013-01-25 07:02:15','2013-01-25 07:02:15','    <header class=\'header-background\'>\r\n      <img src=\'wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wheelchair.jpg\' alt=\'wheelchair transportation\'>\r\n      <div class=\'container\'>\r\n        <div class=\'header-caption\'>\r\n          <h1>\r\n            Non-Emergency Wheelchair Accessible Transportation Services in <abbr title=\'Greater Toronto Area\'>GTA</abbr>.\r\n          </h1>\r\n          <p class=\'lead hidden-phone\'>\r\n            We are dedicated drivers trained to provide wheelchair-accessible transportation services to people with special needs and disabilities.

The city-level information is not available for this keyword. I think the reason is that the search volume for this keyword is substantially smaller than \'wheelchair\' or other popular keywords, so the information is too granular to expose to public.\r\n\r\nThe keyword for \'wheelchair transportation\' shows the similar graph.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/trend4.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" alt=\"wheelchair transportation\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/trend4.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"370\" /></a> keyword \'wheelchair transportation\'[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe pattern looks similar to \'wheelchair taxi\' except that the traffic is now highly concentrated on Ontario. Still overall the search volume is very small.\r\n\r\nI think there are not much data to draw any conclusion in this case because there aren\'t much traffic for wheelchair transportation in general.

Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) mandates that all the businesses regardless of their sizes ensure their services are accessible to people with disabilities. And having wheelchair-accessible ramps could remove physical barriers to enter their businesses, which is the first step to comply with AODA.\r\n\r\nAODA, however, does not regulate the wheelchair ramp designs, so we often see many poorly designed ramps that not only cause negative experiences but also pose a barrier that can be dangerous to people.\r\n\r\nSo, what can be a good wheelchair accessible ramp? How should we install the ramps so that they really benefit people in wheelchairs? There are few things to consider, which are 1) slope, 2) landing experiences, 3) visibility, and 4) maintenance.\r\n<h2>Slope</h2>\r\nThe ramp slope should be low enough to make the climb easier for wheelchair users. If the angle is too steep then it will make the ramp difficult to climb and also could be dangerous. There is currently no regulation regarding the wheelchair ramp slope in Canada<sup>[1]</sup>, but other countries including United States and United Kingdom require a 1:12 slope for wheelchair ramps. This means 1\'\' of rise requires 12\'\' of ramp.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1TvlQzANhAw/UQyWYggQYmI/AAAAAAAAAMI/_5RHTBn2NwA/s569/dec8fa726cea11e2990322000a9f192c_7.jpg\"><img alt=\"wheelchair ramp with lower slope\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1TvlQzANhAw/UQyWYggQYmI/AAAAAAAAAMI/_5RHTBn2NwA/s569/dec8fa726cea11e2990322000a9f192c_7.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a> It is common that slopes \"go around\" the stairs to have a lower slope and longer length.[/caption]\r\n<h2>Landing Experience</h2>\r\nLanding experience is as much important as climb up the ramp. Usually the landing side of the ramp should have enough space to rest and proceed towards the building entrance. We often notice that many businesses do not provide good landing experiences even if they provide wheelchair ramps on their doorsteps.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-etTSTMsbFHg/UQyWX9-YdAI/AAAAAAAAAL4/clO_HlD0YPI/s569/521565_411351278952390_1771367635_n.jpg\"><img class=\" \" alt=\"wheelchair ramp with negative landing experience\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-etTSTMsbFHg/UQyWX9-YdAI/AAAAAAAAAL4/clO_HlD0YPI/s569/521565_411351278952390_1771367635_n.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a> Wheelchair users will have hard time pulling open these doors while on the ramp.[/caption]\r\n<h2>Visibility</h2>\r\nThe wheelchair ramps should be installed close to the stairs and must be visible and apparent to people who need them. Ideally the wheelchair users should be able to find the ramps without any sign, but if the ramps are somehow hard to find due to constructions or temporary disruptions, there must be a sign indicating an alternate route to wheelchair ramps.\r\n<h2>Maintenance</h2>\r\nWinter involves heavy snowfall in Greater Toronto Area and Ontario in general. Maintenance is necessary to ensure that there is no snow accumulation that could block both the approach and the landing of the ramp. This problem could be seen mostly in the sidewalk ramps, where snow is often plowed onto the sidewalk to build the banks and block the ramps.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ENvKGPAHpbU/UQyWYUNrfoI/AAAAAAAAAMA/iYKC7mWA4m4/s569/c0797b9a6cf011e2a94622000a1fbd9f_7.jpg\"><img class=\" \" alt=\"snow covering sidewalk ramps\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ENvKGPAHpbU/UQyWYUNrfoI/AAAAAAAAAMA/iYKC7mWA4m4/s569/c0797b9a6cf011e2a94622000a1fbd9f_7.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a> After heavy snowfall, the hard-packed snow could block the sidewalk ramps.[/caption]\r\n\r\nSlope, landing experience, visibility, and maintenance are some of the things to consider when installing the accessible ramps. It is a bit surprising that Ontario (or Canada) does not provide any regulation on how the ramps should be installed. Since no regulation is enforced there are many ramps out there that are just inadequate to use. The wheelchair ramps at least should meet the points mentioned above to provide better accessibility to wheelchair users.\r\n\r\n[1] In fact, Ontario does specify 1:12 ratio for the ramps in the billing code: <a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_060350_e.htm\">Ontario building code</a>.','What Makes a Good Wheelchair Ramp?','','publish','closed','open','','what-makes-a-good-wheelchair-ramp','','','2013-02-05 00:15:53','2013-02-05 05:15:53','',0,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/?p=56',0,'post','',0),(57,1,'2013-02-01 23:33:22','2013-02-02 04:33:22','Wheelchair-accessible ramps are essential for easier access to buildings and stores that have doorsteps and stairs to their entrances.

Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) mandates that all the businesses regardless of their sizes ensure their services are accessible to people with disabilities. And having wheelchair-accessible ramps could remove physical barriers to enter their businesses, which is the first step to comply with AODA.\r\n\r\nAODA, however, does not regulate the wheelchair ramp designs, so we often see many poorly designed ramps that not only cause negative experiences but also pose a barrier that can be dangerous to people.\r\n\r\nSo, what can be a good wheelchair accessible ramp? How should we install the ramps so that they really benefit people in wheelchairs? There are few things to consider, which are 1) slope, 2) landing experiences, 3) visibility, and 4) maintenance.\r\n<h2>Slope</h2>\r\nThe ramp slope should be low enough to make the climb easier for wheelchair users. If the angle is too steep then it will make the ramp difficult to climb and also could be dangerous. There is currently no regulation regarding the wheelchair ramp slope in Canada, but other countries including United States and United Kingdom require a 1:12 slope for wheelchair ramps. This means 1\'\' of rise requires 12\'\' of ramp.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1TvlQzANhAw/UQyWYggQYmI/AAAAAAAAAMI/_5RHTBn2NwA/s569/dec8fa726cea11e2990322000a9f192c_7.jpg\"><img alt=\"wheelchair ramp with lower slope\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1TvlQzANhAw/UQyWYggQYmI/AAAAAAAAAMI/_5RHTBn2NwA/s569/dec8fa726cea11e2990322000a9f192c_7.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a> It is common that slopes \"go around\" the stairs to have a lower slope and longer length.[/caption]\r\n<h2>Landing Experience</h2>\r\nLanding experience is as much important as climb up the ramp.

The AODA is, as its name implies, an Act to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities in Ontario. But how does it improve the accessibility? We already have the similar Bill: the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (ODA), which was enacted before the AODA. So what is the difference between the AODA and the ODA? How does the AODA enforce the accessibility? In this post we will talk about the purpose of the AODA, how the AODA complements the ODA, and what is its implication for wheelchair users in Ontario.\r\n<h2>What is the AODA and when was it enacted?</h2>\r\nThe AODA is the Act to mandate the accessibility standards and regulations to every business in Ontario to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities using their services. The AODA has been enacted in 2005, and became the law as of January 1, 2012.\r\n<h2>The difference between the ODA and the AODA.</h2>\r\nThe ODA has been enacted in 2002 to \"improve opportunities for persons with disabilities and to provide for their involvement in the identification, removal, and prevention of barriers to their full participation in the life of the province\". The Bill mandates the government\'s commitment to remove the barriers that people with disabilities experience to participating in the society events.\r\n\r\nThe problems with this Bill, however, are that first of all, the Bill did not specify the time-frame for the government to create the barrier-free environment. Secondly, this Bill only applies to the public sectors and left the private sectors unaffected by the Bill. And lastly, the Bill requires the government sectors to prepare accessibility plans as part of their annual planning process, but does not enforce them to implement the plans.\r\n\r\nSo here comes the AODA; the AODA has been enacted in 2005 to complement the ODA with deadlines, enforcement, and penalties. The purpose of the AODA is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards to every organization in Ontario with respect to goods, services, facilities, employment, buildings, structures, and premises, by January 1, 2025.\r\n<h2>The Bill Enforcement</h2>\r\nThe AODA enforces five standards: Customer Service, Transportation, Information &amp; Communications, Employment, and Built Environment. The AODA requires organizations to create accessibility plans indicating how the organizations will implement to meet the regulation for each accessibility standard by the designated deadline. The Act details the procedure the individual organization should take to propose the initial plan, determine the time-frame, and finalize the process. The Act also specifies the government inspection rules and the penalties of the organizations that fail to meet the standard by the deadline.\r\n\r\nEach standard has different deadline. For example, the deadline for the Customer Service standard was January 1, 2012. This means that all the organizations in Ontario must now be compliant with the Customer Service standards since 2012.\r\n<h2>The Current Status of the AODA Compliance</h2>\r\nAs mentioned above, the accessibility standards for Customer Service has been rolled out and its compliance is mandatory for all the organizations in Ontario, whether they be government, business, or charity organizations.\r\n\r\nOther four standards are in progress to set the schedules of compliance. For Employment standard, the current schedule is that the Government of Ontario must be compliant by January 1, 2013, large public sector organizations by January 1, 2014, small public sector organizations by January 1, 2015, large organizations by January 1, 2016, and small organizations by January 1, 2017.\r\n<h2>The Implication to the Wheelchair Users in Ontario</h2>\r\nThe Accessibility Standards for Customer Service is the standard, which applies to any organization that provides goods and services to customers. It sets out the obligations that the organizations must now provide their goods and services in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities. For example, all the restaurants in Ontario should already have established their businesses accessible to customers in wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nToronto Transit Commision (TTC) has made their <a href=\"http://www.ttc.ca/TTC_Accessibility/Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_AODA/Accessible_Customer_Service_Policy_Statement/index.jsp\">Accessible Customer Service Policy public</a>.\r\n\r\nTransportation Standards will be rolled out to public transportation providers between 2011 and 2017, and every transportation service provider should ensure that all of the transportation vehicles be equipped with lifting devices or ramps by January 1, 2013. Also they should not charge people with disabilities higher fare.\r\n\r\nBuilt Environment Standards focus on removing barriers in public spaces and buildings. For the public spaces, however, the standard only applies to new construction and major changes to existing features. This excludes the already built hiking trails and parks that are not wheelchair-accessible.\r\n<h2>Resources</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01o32_e.htm\">Text of the Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>','Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)','','publish','closed','open','','accessibility-for-ontarians-with-disabilities-act-aoda','','','2013-02-13 10:27:26','2013-02-13 15:27:26','',0,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/?p=85',0,'post','',0),(86,1,'2013-02-08 22:50:06','2013-02-09 03:50:06','You might have heard about the news regarding <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/business/small_business/people/2012/12/26/taking_proactive_steps_to_comply_with_the_aoda_is_a_smart_business_move.html\">the businesses trying to comply with Accessibility for the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a>, or you might even have heard about more specific examples of <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.ca/responsibility/diversity/aoda\">Starbucks announcing the commitment to comply with the AODA</a>.

The AODA requires organizations to create accessibility plans indicating how the organizations will implement to meet the regulation for each accessibility standard by the designated deadline. The Act details the procedure the individual organization should take to propose the initial plan, determine the time-frame, and finalize the process. The Act also specifies the government inspection rules and the penalties of the organizations that fail to meet the standard by the deadline.\r\n\r\nEach standard has different deadline. For example, the deadline for the Customer Service standard was January 1, 2012. This means that all the organizations in Ontario must now be compliant with the Customer Service standards since 2012.\r\n<h2>The Current Status of the AODA compliance</h2>\r\nAs mentioned above, the accessibility standards for Customer Service has been rolled out and its compliance is mandatory for all the organizations in Ontario, whether they be government, business, or charity organizations.\r\n<h2>Resources</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01o32_e.htm\">Text of the Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service</a>.</li>\r\n	<li></li>\r\n</ul>','Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)','','inherit','closed','open','','85-revision-12','','','2013-02-08 23:10:12','2013-02-09 04:10:12','',85,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/85-revision-12/',0,'revision','',0),(99,1,'2013-02-08 23:10:14','2013-02-09 04:10:14','[caption id=\"attachment_88\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-88\" alt=\"The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda-300x300.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.[/caption]\r\n\r\nYou might have heard about the news regarding <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/business/small_business/people/2012/12/26/taking_proactive_steps_to_comply_with_the_aoda_is_a_smart_business_move.html\">the businesses trying to comply with Accessibility for the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a>, or you might even have heard about more specific examples of <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.ca/responsibility/diversity/aoda\">Starbucks announcing the commitment to comply with the AODA</a>.

And lastly, the Act requires the government sectors to prepare accessibility plans as part of their annual planning process, but does not enforce them to implement the accessibility plans.\r\n\r\nSo here comes the AODA; the AODA has been enacted in 2005 to complement the ODA with deadlines, enforcement, and penalties. The purpose of the AODA is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards to every organization in Ontario with respect to goods, services, facilities, employment, buildings, structures, and premises, by January 1, 2025.\r\n<h2>The Bill Enforcement</h2>\r\nThe AODA enforces five standards: Customer Service, Transportation, Information &amp; Communications, Employment, and Built Environment. The AODA requires organizations to create accessibility plans indicating how the organizations will implement to meet the regulation for each accessibility standard by the designated deadline. The Act details the procedure the individual organization should take to propose the initial plan, determine the time-frame, and finalize the process. The Act also specifies the government inspection rules and the penalties of the organizations that fail to meet the standard by the deadline.\r\n\r\nEach standard has different deadline. For example, the deadline for the Customer Service standard was January 1, 2012. This means that all the organizations in Ontario must now be compliant with the Customer Service standards since 2012.\r\n<h2>The Current Status of the AODA compliance</h2>\r\nAs mentioned above, the accessibility standards for Customer Service has been rolled out and its compliance is mandatory for all the organizations in Ontario, whether they be government, business, or charity organizations.\r\n<h2>Resources</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01o32_e.htm\">Text of the Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service</a>.</li>\r\n	<li></li>\r\n</ul>','Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)','','inherit','closed','open','','85-revision-13','','','2013-02-08 23:10:14','2013-02-09 04:10:14','',85,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/85-revision-13/',0,'revision','',0),(112,1,'2013-02-10 12:16:20','2013-02-10 17:16:20','[caption id=\"attachment_88\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-88 \" alt=\"The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda-300x300.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> The AODA[/caption]\r\n\r\nThere was a news regarding <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/business/small_business/people/2012/12/26/taking_proactive_steps_to_comply_with_the_aoda_is_a_smart_business_move.html\">the businesses trying to comply with Accessibility for the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a>, or there is a more specific example of <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.ca/responsibility/diversity/aoda\">Starbucks announcing the commitment to comply with the AODA</a>. The AODA is, as its name implies, an Act to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities in Ontario. But how does it improve the accessibility? We already have the similar Bill: the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (ODA), which was enacted before the AODA. So what is the difference between the AODA and the ODA? Let\'s take a look at what the AODA really is, how the AODA complements the ODA, what is its implication for wheelchair users in Ontario.\r\n<h2>What is the AODA and when was it enacted?</h2>\r\nThe AODA is the Act to mandate the accessibility standards and regulations to every business in Ontario to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities using their services. The AODA has been enacted in 2005, and became the law as of January 1, 2012.\r\n<h2>The difference between the ODA and the AODA.</h2>\r\nThe ODA has been enacted in 2002 to \"improve opportunities for persons with disabilities and to provide for their involvement in the identification, removal, and prevention of barriers to their full participation in the life of the province\".

For Employment standard, the current schedule is that the Government of Ontario must be compliant by January 1, 2013, large public sector organizations by January 1, 2014, small public sector organizations by January 1, 2015, large organizations by January 1, 2016, and small organizations by January 1, 2017.\r\n<h2>The implication to the wheelchair users in Ontario</h2>\r\nThe Accessibility Standards for Customer Service is the standard, which applies to any organization that provides goods and services to customers.

For example, all the restaurants in Ontario should already have established their businesses accessible to customers in wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nToronto Transit Commision (TTC) has made their <a href=\"http://www.ttc.ca/TTC_Accessibility/Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_AODA/Accessible_Customer_Service_Policy_Statement/index.jsp\">Accessible Customer Service Policy public</a>.\r\n\r\nTransportation Standards will be rolled out to public transportation providers between 2011 and 2017, and every transportation service provider should ensure that all of the transportation vehicles be equipped with lifting devices or ramps by January 1, 2013. Also they should not charge people with disabilities higher fare.\r\n\r\nBuilt Environment Standards focus on removing barriers in public spaces and buildings. For the public spaces, however, the standard only applies to new construction and major changes to existing features.

We already have the similar Bill: the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (ODA), which was enacted before the AODA. So what is the difference between the AODA and the ODA? Let\'s take a look at what the AODA really is, how the AODA complements the ODA, what is its implication for wheelchair users in Ontario.\r\n<h2>What is the AODA and when was it enacted?</h2>\r\nThe AODA is the Act to mandate the accessibility standards and regulations to every business in Ontario to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities using their services. The AODA has been enacted in 2005, and became the law as of January 1, 2012.\r\n<h2>What is the difference between the ODA and the AODA?</h2>\r\nThe ODA has been enacted in 2002 to \"improve opportunities for persons with disabilities and to provide for their involvement in the identification, removal, and prevention of barriers to their full participation in the life of the province\". The Bill mandates the government\'s commitment to remove the barriers that people with disabilities experience to participating in the society events.\r\n\r\nThe problems with this Bill, however, are that first of all, the Bill did not specify the time-frame for the government to create the barrier-free environment. Secondly, this Act only applies to the public sectors and left the private sectors unaffected by the Bill. And lastly, the Act requires the government sectors to prepare accessibility plans as part of their annual planning process, but does not enforce them to implement the accessibility plans.\r\n\r\nSo here comes the AODA; the AODA has been enacted in 2005 to complement the ODA with deadlines, enforcement, and penalties. The purpose of the AODA is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards to every organization in Ontario with respect to goods, services, facilities, employment, buildings, structures, and premises, by January 1, 2025.\r\n<h2>The Bill Enforcement</h2>\r\nThe AODA enforces five standards: Customer Service, Transportation, Information &amp; Communications, Employment, and Built Environment. The AODA requires organizations to create accessibility plans indicating how the organizations will implement to meet the regulation for each accessibility standard by the designated deadline. The Act details the procedure the individual organization should take to propose the initial plan, determine the time-frame, and finalize the process. The Act also specifies the government inspection rules and the penalties of the organizations that fail to meet the standard by the deadline.\r\n\r\nEach standard has different deadline. For example, the deadline for the Customer Service standard was January 1, 2012. This means that all the organizations in Ontario must now be compliant with the Customer Service standards since 2012.\r\n<h2>The Current Status of the AODA compliance</h2>\r\nAs mentioned above, the accessibility standards for Customer Service has been rolled out and its compliance is mandatory for all the organizations in Ontario, whether they be government, business, or charity organizations.\r\n\r\nOther four standards are in progress to set the schedules of compliance. For Employment standard, the current schedule is that the Government of Ontario must be compliant by January 1, 2013, large public sector organizations by January 1, 2014, small public sector organizations by January 1, 2015, large organizations by January 1, 2016, and small organizations by January 1, 2017.\r\n<h2>The implication to the wheelchair users in Ontario</h2>\r\nThe Accessibility Standards for Customer Service is the standard, which applies to any organization that provides goods and services to customers. It sets out the obligations that the organizations must now provide their goods and services in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities. For example, all the restaurants in Ontario should already have established their businesses accessible to customers in wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nToronto Transit Commision (TTC) has made their <a href=\"http://www.ttc.ca/TTC_Accessibility/Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_AODA/Accessible_Customer_Service_Policy_Statement/index.jsp\">Accessible Customer Service Policy public</a>.\r\n\r\nTransportation Standards will be rolled out to public transportation providers between 2011 and 2017, and every transportation service provider should ensure that all of the transportation vehicles be equipped with lifting devices or ramps by January 1, 2013. Also they should not charge people with disabilities higher fare.\r\n\r\nBuilt Environment Standards focus on removing barriers in public spaces and buildings. For the public spaces, however, the standard only applies to new construction and major changes to existing features. This excludes the already built hiking trails and parks that are not wheelchair-accessible.\r\n<h2>Resources</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01o32_e.htm\">Text of the Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service</a>.</li>\r\n	<li></li>\r\n</ul>','Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)','','inherit','closed','open','','85-revision-16','','','2013-02-08 23:18:51','2013-02-09 04:18:51','',85,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/85-revision-16/',0,'revision','',0),(103,1,'2013-02-08 23:18:54','2013-02-09 04:18:54','[caption id=\"attachment_88\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-88 \" alt=\"The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda-300x300.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> The AODA[/caption]\r\n\r\nYou might have heard about the news regarding <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/business/small_business/people/2012/12/26/taking_proactive_steps_to_comply_with_the_aoda_is_a_smart_business_move.html\">the businesses trying to comply with Accessibility for the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a>, or you might even have heard about more specific examples of <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.ca/responsibility/diversity/aoda\">Starbucks announcing the commitment to comply with the AODA</a>.

The purpose of the AODA is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards to every organization in Ontario with respect to goods, services, facilities, employment, buildings, structures, and premises, by January 1, 2025.\r\n<h2>The Bill Enforcement</h2>\r\nThe AODA enforces five standards: Customer Service, Transportation, Information &amp; Communications, Employment, and Built Environment. The AODA requires organizations to create accessibility plans indicating how the organizations will implement to meet the regulation for each accessibility standard by the designated deadline. The Act details the procedure the individual organization should take to propose the initial plan, determine the time-frame, and finalize the process. The Act also specifies the government inspection rules and the penalties of the organizations that fail to meet the standard by the deadline.\r\n\r\nEach standard has different deadline. For example, the deadline for the Customer Service standard was January 1, 2012. This means that all the organizations in Ontario must now be compliant with the Customer Service standards since 2012.\r\n<h2>The Current Status of the AODA compliance</h2>\r\nAs mentioned above, the accessibility standards for Customer Service has been rolled out and its compliance is mandatory for all the organizations in Ontario, whether they be government, business, or charity organizations.\r\n\r\nOther four standards are in progress to set the schedules of compliance. For Employment standard, the current schedule is that the Government of Ontario must be compliant by January 1, 2013, large public sector organizations by January 1, 2014, small public sector organizations by January 1, 2015, large organizations by January 1, 2016, and small organizations by January 1, 2017.\r\n<h2>The implication to the wheelchair users in Ontario</h2>\r\nThe Accessibility Standards for Customer Service is the standard, which applies to any organization that provides goods and services to customers. It sets out the obligations that the organizations must now provide their goods and services in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities. For example, all the restaurants in Ontario should already have established their businesses accessible to customers in wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nToronto Transit Commision (TTC) has made their <a href=\"http://www.ttc.ca/TTC_Accessibility/Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_AODA/Accessible_Customer_Service_Policy_Statement/index.jsp\">Accessible Customer Service Policy public</a>.\r\n\r\nTransportation Standards will be rolled out to public transportation providers between 2011 and 2017, and every transportation service provider should ensure that all of the transportation vehicles be equipped with lifting devices or ramps by January 1, 2013. Also they should not charge people with disabilities higher fare.\r\n\r\nBuilt Environment Standards focus on removing barriers in public spaces and buildings. For the public spaces, however, the standard only applies to new construction and major changes to existing features. This excludes the already built hiking trails and parks that are not wheelchair-accessible.\r\n<h2>Resources</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01o32_e.htm\">Text of the Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service</a>.</li>\r\n	<li></li>\r\n</ul>','Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)','','inherit','closed','open','','85-revision-21','','','2013-02-08 23:21:01','2013-02-09 04:21:01','',85,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/85-revision-21/',0,'revision','',0),(108,1,'2013-02-08 23:22:40','2013-02-09 04:22:40','[caption id=\"attachment_88\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-88 \" alt=\"The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda-300x300.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> The AODA[/caption]\r\n\r\nYou might have heard about the news regarding <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/business/small_business/people/2012/12/26/taking_proactive_steps_to_comply_with_the_aoda_is_a_smart_business_move.html\">the businesses trying to comply with Accessibility for the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a>, or you might even have heard about more specific examples of <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.ca/responsibility/diversity/aoda\">Starbucks announcing the commitment to comply with the AODA</a>. The AODA is, as its name implies, an Act to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities in Ontario. But how does it improve the accessibility? We already have the similar Bill: the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (ODA), which was enacted before the AODA. So what is the difference between the AODA and the ODA?

The Bill mandates the government\'s commitment to remove the barriers that people with disabilities experience to participating in the society events.\r\n\r\nThe problems with this Bill, however, are that first of all, the Bill did not specify the time-frame for the government to create the barrier-free environment.

The AODA is, as its name implies, an Act to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities in Ontario. But how does it improve the accessibility? We already have the similar Bill: the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (ODA), which was enacted before the AODA. So what is the difference between the AODA and the ODA? Let\'s take a look at what the AODA really is, how the AODA complements the ODA, what is its implication for wheelchair users in Ontario.\r\n<h2>What is the AODA and when was it enacted?</h2>\r\nThe AODA is the Act to mandate the accessibility standards and regulations to every business in Ontario to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities using their services. The AODA has been enacted in 2005, and became the law as of January 1, 2012.\r\n<h2>The difference between the ODA and the AODA.</h2>\r\nThe ODA has been enacted in 2002 to \"improve opportunities for persons with disabilities and to provide for their involvement in the identification, removal, and prevention of barriers to their full participation in the life of the province\". The Bill mandates the government\'s commitment to remove the barriers that people with disabilities experience to participating in the society events.\r\n\r\nThe problems with this Bill, however, are that first of all, the Bill did not specify the time-frame for the government to create the barrier-free environment. Secondly, this Act only applies to the public sectors and left the private sectors unaffected by the Bill. And lastly, the Act requires the government sectors to prepare accessibility plans as part of their annual planning process, but does not enforce them to implement the plans.\r\n\r\nSo here comes the AODA; the AODA has been enacted in 2005 to complement the ODA with deadlines, enforcement, and penalties. The purpose of the AODA is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards to every organization in Ontario with respect to goods, services, facilities, employment, buildings, structures, and premises, by January 1, 2025.\r\n<h2>The Bill Enforcement</h2>\r\nThe AODA enforces five standards: Customer Service, Transportation, Information &amp; Communications, Employment, and Built Environment. The AODA requires organizations to create accessibility plans indicating how the organizations will implement to meet the regulation for each accessibility standard by the designated deadline. The Act details the procedure the individual organization should take to propose the initial plan, determine the time-frame, and finalize the process. The Act also specifies the government inspection rules and the penalties of the organizations that fail to meet the standard by the deadline.\r\n\r\nEach standard has different deadline. For example, the deadline for the Customer Service standard was January 1, 2012. This means that all the organizations in Ontario must now be compliant with the Customer Service standards since 2012.\r\n<h2>The Current Status of the AODA compliance</h2>\r\nAs mentioned above, the accessibility standards for Customer Service has been rolled out and its compliance is mandatory for all the organizations in Ontario, whether they be government, business, or charity organizations.\r\n\r\nOther four standards are in progress to set the schedules of compliance. For Employment standard, the current schedule is that the Government of Ontario must be compliant by January 1, 2013, large public sector organizations by January 1, 2014, small public sector organizations by January 1, 2015, large organizations by January 1, 2016, and small organizations by January 1, 2017.\r\n<h2>The implication to the wheelchair users in Ontario</h2>\r\nThe Accessibility Standards for Customer Service is the standard, which applies to any organization that provides goods and services to customers. It sets out the obligations that the organizations must now provide their goods and services in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities. For example, all the restaurants in Ontario should already have established their businesses accessible to customers in wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nToronto Transit Commision (TTC) has made their <a href=\"http://www.ttc.ca/TTC_Accessibility/Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_AODA/Accessible_Customer_Service_Policy_Statement/index.jsp\">Accessible Customer Service Policy public</a>.\r\n\r\nTransportation Standards will be rolled out to public transportation providers between 2011 and 2017, and every transportation service provider should ensure that all of the transportation vehicles be equipped with lifting devices or ramps by January 1, 2013. Also they should not charge people with disabilities higher fare.\r\n\r\nBuilt Environment Standards focus on removing barriers in public spaces and buildings. For the public spaces, however, the standard only applies to new construction and major changes to existing features. This excludes the already built hiking trails and parks that are not wheelchair-accessible.\r\n<h2>Resources</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01o32_e.htm\">Text of the Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service</a>.</li>\r\n	<li></li>\r\n</ul>','Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)','','inherit','closed','open','','85-revision-27','','','2013-02-10 12:16:36','2013-02-10 17:16:36','',85,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/85-revision-27/',0,'revision','',0),(115,1,'2013-02-10 12:16:38','2013-02-10 17:16:38','[caption id=\"attachment_88\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-88 \" alt=\"The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda-300x300.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> The AODA[/caption]\r\n\r\nThere is a news regarding <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/business/small_business/people/2012/12/26/taking_proactive_steps_to_comply_with_the_aoda_is_a_smart_business_move.html\">the businesses trying to comply with Accessibility for the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a>, or there is a more specific example of <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.ca/responsibility/diversity/aoda\">Starbucks announcing the commitment to comply with the AODA</a>.

The purpose of the AODA is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards to every organization in Ontario with respect to goods, services, facilities, employment, buildings, structures, and premises, by January 1, 2025.\r\n<h2>The Bill Enforcement</h2>\r\nThe AODA enforces five standards: Customer Service, Transportation, Information &amp; Communications, Employment, and Built Environment. The AODA requires organizations to create accessibility plans indicating how the organizations will implement to meet the regulation for each accessibility standard by the designated deadline. The Act details the procedure the individual organization should take to propose the initial plan, determine the time-frame, and finalize the process. The Act also specifies the government inspection rules and the penalties of the organizations that fail to meet the standard by the deadline.\r\n\r\nEach standard has different deadline. For example, the deadline for the Customer Service standard was January 1, 2012. This means that all the organizations in Ontario must now be compliant with the Customer Service standards since 2012.\r\n<h2>The Current Status of the AODA compliance</h2>\r\nAs mentioned above, the accessibility standards for Customer Service has been rolled out and its compliance is mandatory for all the organizations in Ontario, whether they be government, business, or charity organizations.\r\n\r\nOther four standards are in progress to set the schedules of compliance. For Employment standard, the current schedule is that the Government of Ontario must be compliant by January 1, 2013, large public sector organizations by January 1, 2014, small public sector organizations by January 1, 2015, large organizations by January 1, 2016, and small organizations by January 1, 2017.\r\n<h2>The implication to the wheelchair users in Ontario</h2>\r\nThe Accessibility Standards for Customer Service is the standard, which applies to any organization that provides goods and services to customers. It sets out the obligations that the organizations must now provide their goods and services in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities. For example, all the restaurants in Ontario should already have established their businesses accessible to customers in wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nToronto Transit Commision (TTC) has made their <a href=\"http://www.ttc.ca/TTC_Accessibility/Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_AODA/Accessible_Customer_Service_Policy_Statement/index.jsp\">Accessible Customer Service Policy public</a>.\r\n\r\nTransportation Standards will be rolled out to public transportation providers between 2011 and 2017, and every transportation service provider should ensure that all of the transportation vehicles be equipped with lifting devices or ramps by January 1, 2013. Also they should not charge people with disabilities higher fare.\r\n\r\nBuilt Environment Standards focus on removing barriers in public spaces and buildings. For the public spaces, however, the standard only applies to new construction and major changes to existing features. This excludes the already built hiking trails and parks that are not wheelchair-accessible.\r\n<h2>Resources</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01o32_e.htm\">Text of the Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service</a>.</li>\r\n	<li></li>\r\n</ul>','Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)','','inherit','closed','open','','85-revision-31','','','2013-02-11 00:54:42','2013-02-11 05:54:42','',85,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/85-revision-31/',0,'revision','',0),(119,1,'2013-02-11 00:56:15','2013-02-11 05:56:15','[caption id=\"attachment_88\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-88 \" alt=\"The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda-300x300.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> The AODA[/caption]\r\n\r\nThere is a news regarding <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/business/small_business/people/2012/12/26/taking_proactive_steps_to_comply_with_the_aoda_is_a_smart_business_move.html\">the businesses trying to comply with the Accessibility for the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a>, or there is a more specific example of <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.ca/responsibility/diversity/aoda\">Starbucks announcing the commitment to comply with the AODA</a>.

The AODA is, as its name implies, an Act to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities in Ontario. But how does it improve the accessibility? We already have the similar Bill: the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (ODA), which was enacted before the AODA. So what is the difference between the AODA and the ODA? How does the AODA enforce the accessibility? In this post we will talk about the purpose of the AODA, how the AODA complements the ODA, and what is its implication for wheelchair users in Ontario.\r\n<h2>What is the AODA and when was it enacted?</h2>\r\nThe AODA is the Act to mandate the accessibility standards and regulations to every business in Ontario to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities using their services. The AODA has been enacted in 2005, and became the law as of January 1, 2012.\r\n<h2>The difference between the ODA and the AODA.</h2>\r\nThe ODA has been enacted in 2002 to \"improve opportunities for persons with disabilities and to provide for their involvement in the identification, removal, and prevention of barriers to their full participation in the life of the province\". The Bill mandates the government\'s commitment to remove the barriers that people with disabilities experience to participating in the society events.\r\n\r\nThe problems with this Bill, however, are that first of all, the Bill did not specify the time-frame for the government to create the barrier-free environment. Secondly, this Bill only applies to the public sectors and left the private sectors unaffected by the Bill. And lastly, the Bill requires the government sectors to prepare accessibility plans as part of their annual planning process, but does not enforce them to implement the plans.\r\n\r\nSo here comes the AODA; the AODA has been enacted in 2005 to complement the ODA with deadlines, enforcement, and penalties. The purpose of the AODA is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards to every organization in Ontario with respect to goods, services, facilities, employment, buildings, structures, and premises, by January 1, 2025.\r\n<h2>The Bill Enforcement</h2>\r\nThe AODA enforces five standards: Customer Service, Transportation, Information &amp; Communications, Employment, and Built Environment. The AODA requires organizations to create accessibility plans indicating how the organizations will implement to meet the regulation for each accessibility standard by the designated deadline. The Act details the procedure the individual organization should take to propose the initial plan, determine the time-frame, and finalize the process. The Act also specifies the government inspection rules and the penalties of the organizations that fail to meet the standard by the deadline.\r\n\r\nEach standard has different deadline. For example, the deadline for the Customer Service standard was January 1, 2012. This means that all the organizations in Ontario must now be compliant with the Customer Service standards since 2012.\r\n<h2>The Current Status of the AODA compliance</h2>\r\nAs mentioned above, the accessibility standards for Customer Service has been rolled out and its compliance is mandatory for all the organizations in Ontario, whether they be government, business, or charity organizations.\r\n\r\nOther four standards are in progress to set the schedules of compliance. For Employment standard, the current schedule is that the Government of Ontario must be compliant by January 1, 2013, large public sector organizations by January 1, 2014, small public sector organizations by January 1, 2015, large organizations by January 1, 2016, and small organizations by January 1, 2017.\r\n<h2>The implication to the wheelchair users in Ontario</h2>\r\nThe Accessibility Standards for Customer Service is the standard, which applies to any organization that provides goods and services to customers. It sets out the obligations that the organizations must now provide their goods and services in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities. For example, all the restaurants in Ontario should already have established their businesses accessible to customers in wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nToronto Transit Commision (TTC) has made their <a href=\"http://www.ttc.ca/TTC_Accessibility/Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_AODA/Accessible_Customer_Service_Policy_Statement/index.jsp\">Accessible Customer Service Policy public</a>.\r\n\r\nTransportation Standards will be rolled out to public transportation providers between 2011 and 2017, and every transportation service provider should ensure that all of the transportation vehicles be equipped with lifting devices or ramps by January 1, 2013. Also they should not charge people with disabilities higher fare.\r\n\r\nBuilt Environment Standards focus on removing barriers in public spaces and buildings. For the public spaces, however, the standard only applies to new construction and major changes to existing features. This excludes the already built hiking trails and parks that are not wheelchair-accessible.\r\n<h2>Resources</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01o32_e.htm\">Text of the Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service</a>.</li>\r\n	<li></li>\r\n</ul>','Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)','','inherit','closed','open','','85-revision-36','','','2013-02-11 00:58:00','2013-02-11 05:58:00','',85,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/85-revision-36/',0,'revision','',0),(124,1,'2013-02-11 00:58:02','2013-02-11 05:58:02','[caption id=\"attachment_88\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-88 \" alt=\"The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aoda-300x300.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> The AODA[/caption]\r\n\r\nThere is a news regarding <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/business/small_business/people/2012/12/26/taking_proactive_steps_to_comply_with_the_aoda_is_a_smart_business_move.html\">the businesses trying to comply with the Accessibility for the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a>, or there is a more specific example of <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.ca/responsibility/diversity/aoda\">Starbucks announcing the commitment to comply with the AODA</a>.

The purpose of the AODA is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards to every organization in Ontario with respect to goods, services, facilities, employment, buildings, structures, and premises, by January 1, 2025.\r\n<h2>The Bill Enforcement</h2>\r\nThe AODA enforces five standards: Customer Service, Transportation, Information &amp; Communications, Employment, and Built Environment. The AODA requires organizations to create accessibility plans indicating how the organizations will implement to meet the regulation for each accessibility standard by the designated deadline. The Act details the procedure the individual organization should take to propose the initial plan, determine the time-frame, and finalize the process. The Act also specifies the government inspection rules and the penalties of the organizations that fail to meet the standard by the deadline.\r\n\r\nEach standard has different deadline. For example, the deadline for the Customer Service standard was January 1, 2012. This means that all the organizations in Ontario must now be compliant with the Customer Service standards since 2012.\r\n<h2>The Current Status of the AODA compliance</h2>\r\nAs mentioned above, the accessibility standards for Customer Service has been rolled out and its compliance is mandatory for all the organizations in Ontario, whether they be government, business, or charity organizations.\r\n\r\nOther four standards are in progress to set the schedules of compliance. For Employment standard, the current schedule is that the Government of Ontario must be compliant by January 1, 2013, large public sector organizations by January 1, 2014, small public sector organizations by January 1, 2015, large organizations by January 1, 2016, and small organizations by January 1, 2017.\r\n<h2>The implication to the wheelchair users in Ontario</h2>\r\nThe Accessibility Standards for Customer Service is the standard, which applies to any organization that provides goods and services to customers. It sets out the obligations that the organizations must now provide their goods and services in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities. For example, all the restaurants in Ontario should already have established their businesses accessible to customers in wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nToronto Transit Commision (TTC) has made their <a href=\"http://www.ttc.ca/TTC_Accessibility/Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_AODA/Accessible_Customer_Service_Policy_Statement/index.jsp\">Accessible Customer Service Policy public</a>.\r\n\r\nTransportation Standards will be rolled out to public transportation providers between 2011 and 2017, and every transportation service provider should ensure that all of the transportation vehicles be equipped with lifting devices or ramps by January 1, 2013. Also they should not charge people with disabilities higher fare.\r\n\r\nBuilt Environment Standards focus on removing barriers in public spaces and buildings. For the public spaces, however, the standard only applies to new construction and major changes to existing features. This excludes the already built hiking trails and parks that are not wheelchair-accessible.\r\n<h2>Resources</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01o32_e.htm\">Text of the Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service</a>.</li>\r\n	<li></li>\r\n</ul>','Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)','','inherit','closed','open','','85-revision-39','','','2013-02-11 01:00:32','2013-02-11 06:00:32','',85,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/85-revision-39/',0,'revision','',0),(128,1,'2013-02-13 21:41:30','2013-02-14 02:41:30','[caption id=\"attachment_145\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/finch.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-145\" alt=\"Finch TTC Station\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/finch-300x171.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"171\" /></a> Finch TTC Station[/caption]\r\n\r\nFinch TTC Station is the most northernmost station in Yonge-subway line and is wheelchair-accessible.

The problem with this lift is that you cannot get it to your level if it is on the other side.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q20clUbej5I\r\n\r\nThe landing instruction of the lift seems outdated or does not clearly explain how I could get the lift to my level. The only button I did not press is \"Call for assistance\", which I would find it annoying if I had to call the service attendant every time I use the lift.\r\n\r\nOnce you are inside the paid area, you can see the elevator next to the fare gate that leads to the subway platform, and you can also find the washroom, which is wheelchair-accessible. There are one wheelchair stall and two non-wheelchair stalls. The wheelchair stall is neither particularly cleaner nor dirtier than the other stalls.\r\n\r\nThere is also another elevator that leads to the upper level, where you take another elevator to the bus platform. I took another movie clip from the bus platform to the subway platform.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OY8ASFCOlw\r\n\r\nI am not a wheelchair user and there would be more stuff that I missed which the actual wheelchair users would find inconvenient, but I think there are two issues that need to be improved:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">The lift needs to be fixed unless it is intentional to call for assistance every time the lift is used.</span></li>\r\n	<li>The North American Life Centre does not have a clear sign how to enter the building with wheelchairs.

The problem with this life is that you cannot get the lift to your level if it is on the other level.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q20clUbej5I\r\n\r\nThe landing instruction of the lift seems outdated or does not clearly explain how I could get the lift to my level. The only button I did not press is \"Call for assistance\", which I would find it annoying if I had to call the service attendant every time I use the lift.\r\n\r\nOnce you are inside the paid area, you can see the elevator next to the fare gate that leads to the subway platform, and you can also find the washroom, which is wheelchair-accessible. There are one wheelchair stall and two non-wheelchair stalls.

The AODA is, as its name implies, an Act to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities in Ontario. But how does it improve the accessibility? We already have the similar Bill: the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (ODA), which was enacted before the AODA. So what is the difference between the AODA and the ODA? How does the AODA enforce the accessibility? In this post we will talk about the purpose of the AODA, how the AODA complements the ODA, and what is its implication for wheelchair users in Ontario.\r\n<h2>What is the AODA and when was it enacted?</h2>\r\nThe AODA is the Act to mandate the accessibility standards and regulations to every business in Ontario to improve the accessibility for people with disabilities using their services. The AODA has been enacted in 2005, and became the law as of January 1, 2012.\r\n<h2>The difference between the ODA and the AODA.</h2>\r\nThe ODA has been enacted in 2002 to \"improve opportunities for persons with disabilities and to provide for their involvement in the identification, removal, and prevention of barriers to their full participation in the life of the province\". The Bill mandates the government\'s commitment to remove the barriers that people with disabilities experience to participating in the society events.\r\n\r\nThe problems with this Bill, however, are that first of all, the Bill did not specify the time-frame for the government to create the barrier-free environment. Secondly, this Bill only applies to the public sectors and left the private sectors unaffected by the Bill. And lastly, the Bill requires the government sectors to prepare accessibility plans as part of their annual planning process, but does not enforce them to implement the plans.\r\n\r\nSo here comes the AODA; the AODA has been enacted in 2005 to complement the ODA with deadlines, enforcement, and penalties. The purpose of the AODA is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards to every organization in Ontario with respect to goods, services, facilities, employment, buildings, structures, and premises, by January 1, 2025.\r\n<h2>The Bill Enforcement</h2>\r\nThe AODA enforces five standards: Customer Service, Transportation, Information &amp; Communications, Employment, and Built Environment. The AODA requires organizations to create accessibility plans indicating how the organizations will implement to meet the regulation for each accessibility standard by the designated deadline. The Act details the procedure the individual organization should take to propose the initial plan, determine the time-frame, and finalize the process. The Act also specifies the government inspection rules and the penalties of the organizations that fail to meet the standard by the deadline.\r\n\r\nEach standard has different deadline. For example, the deadline for the Customer Service standard was January 1, 2012. This means that all the organizations in Ontario must now be compliant with the Customer Service standards since 2012.\r\n<h2>The Current Status of the AODA compliance</h2>\r\nAs mentioned above, the accessibility standards for Customer Service has been rolled out and its compliance is mandatory for all the organizations in Ontario, whether they be government, business, or charity organizations.\r\n\r\nOther four standards are in progress to set the schedules of compliance. For Employment standard, the current schedule is that the Government of Ontario must be compliant by January 1, 2013, large public sector organizations by January 1, 2014, small public sector organizations by January 1, 2015, large organizations by January 1, 2016, and small organizations by January 1, 2017.\r\n<h2>The implication to the wheelchair users in Ontario</h2>\r\nThe Accessibility Standards for Customer Service is the standard, which applies to any organization that provides goods and services to customers. It sets out the obligations that the organizations must now provide their goods and services in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities. For example, all the restaurants in Ontario should already have established their businesses accessible to customers in wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nToronto Transit Commision (TTC) has made their <a href=\"http://www.ttc.ca/TTC_Accessibility/Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_AODA/Accessible_Customer_Service_Policy_Statement/index.jsp\">Accessible Customer Service Policy public</a>.\r\n\r\nTransportation Standards will be rolled out to public transportation providers between 2011 and 2017, and every transportation service provider should ensure that all of the transportation vehicles be equipped with lifting devices or ramps by January 1, 2013. Also they should not charge people with disabilities higher fare.\r\n\r\nBuilt Environment Standards focus on removing barriers in public spaces and buildings. For the public spaces, however, the standard only applies to new construction and major changes to existing features. This excludes the already built hiking trails and parks that are not wheelchair-accessible.\r\n<h2>Resources</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01o32_e.htm\">Text of the Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm\">Text of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>','Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)','','inherit','closed','open','','85-revision-40','','','2013-02-11 07:23:34','2013-02-11 12:23:34','',85,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/85-revision-40/',0,'revision','',0),(158,1,'2013-02-13 02:39:40','2013-02-13 07:39:40','[caption id=\"attachment_145\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/finch.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-145\" alt=\"Finch TTC Station\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/finch-300x171.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"171\" /></a> Finch TTC Station[/caption]\r\n\r\nFinch TTC Station is the most northernmost station in Yonge-subway line and is wheelchair-accessible.

For instance, Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) can provide up to $90,000 for the entire lifetime. Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefits is a monthly payment (~$841.95/month, 2012-basis) to people who are eligible for the benefit. Grant for Students with Permanent Disabilities provides students $2,000 / year to help cover their tuition expenses.\r\n<h2>Registered Disability Savings Plan</h2>\r\nThis is a long-term savings plan available for individuals who are under 60 and eligible for the Disability Tax Credit. It is similar to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) in a way that the earnings from your savings will remain tax-free until you withdraw money out of the RDSP later. You need to have Social Insurance Number (SIN) to be considered eligible and the lifetime contribution limit is $200,000, although there is no annual limit.\r\n\r\nThe government provides two additional financial support programs that could match your RDSP savings up to maximum $90,000 over your lifetime: Canada Disability Savings Grant and Canada Disability Savings Bond.\r\n<h3>Canada Disability Savings Grant</h3>\r\nCanada Disability Savings Grant (CDSG) is a matching grant that the government deposits into your RDSP. The maximum grant amount is $3,500 / year and the lifetime amount is $70,000, but the actual amount depends on the family income and the amount of annual savings.\r\n\r\nIf the family income is below $87,123, then the government gives $3,500 for $1,500 contributed a year. You may contribute more than $1,500, but there is no more matching grant beyond $1,500. If the family income is above $87,123, then the government gives $1,000 for $1,000 contributed a year. You may contribute more than $1,000, but there is no more matching grant beyond $1,000. You can receive the government grant up to $70,000 for your lifetime.\r\n<h3>Canada Disability Savings Bond</h3>\r\nCanada Disability Savings Bond (CDSB) is a program for low-income and modest-income families whose annual income is below $43,561. The government will deposit $1,000 / year to your RDSP if your income is below $25,356, and this amount will decrease as your annual income increases. If your annual income is above $43,561, there is no more benefit. You do not need to make any contribution to your RDSP to receive the benefit. You can receive the bond amount up to $20,000 for your lifetime.\r\n<h2>Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit</h2>\r\nCanada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit is a monthly benefit available to individuals who has made enough contributions to the CPP, but could not work any longer because of disability. You may be considered eligible if you are under 65, stopped working because of a medical condition, and has contributed to the CPP while working.\r\n\r\nThe actual monthly amount depends on how much you have contributed to the CPP, but the average amount was $841.95 / month on 2012, and the maximum amount was $1212.90 / month. The amount will be re-adjusted on January every year if there are increases in the cost of living.\r\n<h2>Grant for Students with Permanent Disabilities</h2>\r\nThere is a grant available to students studying in universities and post-secondary institutions. If you apply and qualify for a Canada Student Loan, you can be eligible for receiving this grant as well. You can receive $2,000 per academic year to help cover your tuition, books, and accommodation costs.','Financial Assistance for People with Disabilities','','publish','closed','open','','financial-assistance-for-people-with-disabilities','','','2013-03-01 00:09:18','2013-03-01 05:09:18','',0,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/?p=189',0,'post','',0),(190,1,'2013-02-26 21:54:58','2013-02-27 02:54:58','','rdsp','','inherit','closed','open','','rdsp','','','2013-02-26 21:54:58','2013-02-27 02:54:58','',189,'http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rdsp.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(191,1,'2013-02-26 22:05:41','2013-02-27 03:05:41','<a href=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rdsp.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-190\" alt=\"financial program\" src=\"http://savewheelchairtrans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rdsp-300x199.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a>\n\nThere are several programs that can provide financial supports to people with disabilities.

For instance, Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) can provide up to $90,000 for the entire lifetime. Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefits is a monthly payment (~$841.95/month, 2012-basis) to people who are eligible for the benefit. Grant for Students with Permanent Disabilities provides students $2,000 / year to help cover their tuition expenses.\r\n<h2>Registered Disability Savings Plan</h2>\r\nThis is a long-term savings plan available for individuals who are under 60 and eligible for the Disability Tax Credit. It is similar to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) in a way that the earnings from your savings will remain tax-free until you withdraw money out of the RDSP later. You need to have Social Insurance Number (SIN) to be considered eligible and the lifetime contribution limit is $200,000, although there is no annual limit.\r\n\r\nThe government provides two additional financial support programs that could match your RDSP savings up to maximum $90,000 over your lifetime: Canada Disability Savings Grant and Canada Disability Savings Bond.\r\n<h3>Canada Disability Savings Grant</h3>\r\nCanada Disability Savings Grant (CDSG) is a matching grant that the government deposits into your RDSP. The maximum grant amount is $3,500 / year and the lifetime amount is $70,000, but the actual amount depends on the family income and the amount of annual savings.\r\n\r\nIf the family income is below $87,123, then the government gives $3,500 for $1,500 contributed a year. You may contribute more than $1,500, but there is no more matching grant beyond $1,500. If the family income is above $87,123, then the government gives $1,000 for $1,000 contributed a year. You may contribute more than $1,000, but there is no more matching grant beyond $1,000. You can receive the government grant up to $70,000 for your lifetime.\r\n<h3>Canada Disability Savings Bond</h3>\r\nCanada Disability Savings Bond (CDSB) is a program for low-income and modest-income families whose annual income is below $43,561. The government will deposit $1,000 / year to your RDSP if your income is below $25,356, and this amount will decrease as your annual income increases. If your annual income is above $43,561, there is no more benefit. You do not need to make any contribution to your RDSP to receive the benefit. You can receive the bond amount up to $20,000 for your lifetime.\r\n<h2>Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit</h2>\r\nCanada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit is a monthly benefit available to individuals who has made enough contributions to the CPP, but could not work any longer because of disability. You may be considered eligible if you are under 65, stopped working because of a medical condition, and has contributed to the CPP while working.\r\n\r\nThe actual monthly amount depends on how much you have contributed to the CPP, but the average amount was $841.95 / month on 2012, and the maximum amount was $1212.90 / month. The amount will be re-adjusted on January every year if there are increases in the cost of living.\r\n<h2>Grant for Students with Permanent Disabilities</h2>\r\nThere is a grant available to students studying in universities and post-secondary institutions.
